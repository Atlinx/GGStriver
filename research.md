- [Google DeepMind AlphaStart](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphastar-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/)
  - Google made an AI to play StarCraft II
  - Played against itself to improve
  - Initially used imitation learning to train off of replay data of professional players
  - [StarCraft 2 research environment](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-as-an-ai-research-environment/)
    - Idea -> use GGST replay data to train instead of recreating
- [Google MuZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules/)
